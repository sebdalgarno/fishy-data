    "contents": "\nI have been reading this great paper by Brownscombe et al., which outlines a practical approach to accounting for detection range (DR) variation in acoustic telemetry arrays. As an example of the pitfalls of failing to account for variation in DR, Brownscombe points to a study by Payne et al. (2010) on the diel patterns in use of nearshore habitats by cuttlefish. Whereas the raw data showed that cuttlefish used these areas more during the day, the corrected data showed that they used these areas more at night. Not only did this affect the effect size, but it completely changed the directionality of the effect, which fundamentally changes our understanding of the species biology and how to manage them!\nWhy is there variation in detection range?\nIn acoustic telemetry studies, we typically set up an array of stationary receivers within a study area and tag some animals with acoustic transmitters. These animals (let’s say fish) swim around sending out supersonic acoustic transmissions every few seconds. When the fish passes within the receivers detection range, the receiver records the unique id of the transmitter and time of detection. So far, pretty straightforward (at least from a data perspective, not logistically!) The tricky part is that detection efficiency (DE) decreases with distance from receiver and the DR for each receiver varies in space and time.\nSo what causes this variation?\nFirst, these acoustic signals may never reach the receiver as they can be:\nattenuated, retracted, or lost due to spreading in water.\ndisrupted by physical barriers.\nmuted by environmental or biological noise.\nSecond, the signal could be wrongly interpreted by the receiver (i.e. false detection) if:\ntags are mutated by noise but still decoded by a receiver.\ntags operating on the same frequemcy collide with one another and arrive at the receiver simultaneously.\nThese are imperfect sampling systems that are affected by conditions in the surrounding environment (e.g. rugosity, depth, anthropogenic or environmental noise) and how many other tags exist in the study area (with more tags leading to less DE).\nHow do we deal with this variation to correct our analyses?\nFrist some definitions:\n- DR - the 3-dimensional space surrounding a receiver that a transmitter can be detected in\n- DE (%) - # detections in given time period / total expected detections based on transmission rate * 100\n- MR - estimated distance from receiver with 5% DE\n- Midpoint - estimated distance from receiver with 50% DE\n- DEv - difference between detection efficiency in given time period and mean detection efficiency of reference tag\n- DEvc - DEv standardized to +/- 50% (across receivers)\n- DRc - DR correction facto derived from MR and DEvc\n- Det - number of detections\n- Detc - number of detections corrected using DRc\nBrownscombe suggests a practical approach to deal with this issue:\n1. Select a set of sentinel receivers that represent the full range of environmental conditions (these will be used to predict DE at the rest of the receivers) and measure/record site characteristics in space (e.g. depth, benthos) and time (e.g. tide, diel period).\n1. Quantify the MR and Midpoint at each sentinel receiver. This can be done by dropping a tag at various distances from a receiver, measuring DE and modelling the relationship between efficiency and distance to estimate the Midpoint and MR.\n1. Quanitfy the variance in DE (DEv) at each sentinel receiver. This is done by dropping a reference tag (i.e., tag with longer transmission delay ~200-700 seconds) at the Midpoint (e.g. 200m away) and leaving it there for the duration of the study.\n1. Calculate detection range correction factor (DRc). This uses DEv and MR.\n1. Model relationship between DRc and site characteristics to predict DRc at other receivers in array.\n1. Correct detection data using predicted DRc.\nTo make this process more clear, I’ll simulate some data and show the R code to calculate each step. Note that I referenced the code provided in Brownscombe et al. supplementary info, but have modified it quite a bit.\nCalculate Midpoint and MR\nStep 1: Create some fake receivers at different depths, half of which are sentinels.\n\n   receiver     depth sentinel\n1         1 13.770678     TRUE\n2         2  6.706725    FALSE\n3         3 15.263971     TRUE\n4         4 19.887632    FALSE\n5         5 13.024904     TRUE\n6         6 19.499211    FALSE\n7         7 15.071413     TRUE\n8         8  9.418666    FALSE\n9         9 10.375445     TRUE\n10       10  7.629721    FALSE\n11       11 13.232261     TRUE\n12       12 12.581776    FALSE\n13       13  7.907547     TRUE\n14       14 14.553562    FALSE\n15       15 15.317001     TRUE\n16       16 14.602862    FALSE\n\nStep 2: Simulate some detection range data, where depth has an effect on the DE curve.\n\n\n\nWe can estimate the Midpoint and MR for each sentinel receiver by modelling the relationship between DE and distance for each receiver. Here, we use a generalized linear model with binomial family (logistic regression), although Brownscombe et al. used a third-order polynomial liner regression with forced y-intercept at 1.\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve calculated our Midpoints for each sentinel, let’s put a reference tag there to calculate DE over time. We’ll simulate some data where DE has a positive relationship with day and the magnitude of the effect increases with depth. This is not very realistic (a seasonal effect would be better and I don’t know if influence of depth is a realistic mechanism) but it’ll work just for demonstration purposes.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nWhat is partial migration?\nPartial migration describes the phenomenon of different migratory behaviours within a population. Three types of seasonal partial migration are defined in Chapman (2011a): 1. non-breeding partial migration occurs when migrants and residents breed sympatricaly but overwinter apart; 2. breeding partial migration occurs when migrants and residents overwinter together but breed allopatrically; 3. skiiped breeding partial migration occurs when individuals do not migrate to breed every year. A fourth kind of partial pigration over shorter spatiotempporal scales is also defined. Partial diel vertical migration (DVM) occurs when some individuals migrate verticale but others remain in the same pace within the water column.\nEach migratory group is called a ‘contingent’. In some cases, contingents differ phenotypically (e.g. resident rainbow trout and migrant steelhead trout) making their identification relateively easy. Technologies to directly (e.g. capture-recapture, telemetry) or indirectly (e.g., otolith microchemistry, stable isotope, molecular analysis) observe movement patterns can be used.\nIn Chapman’s (2011a) review of partial migration, they state that Acipensiformes exhibit skipped breeding partial migration as adults only spawn every few years. No other evidence of partial migration is provided. However, breeding partial migration in Acipensiformes is disputed in Rideout (2005), who state that cases where process of vitellogenesis takes longer than a year (multiyear ripening) are not capable of spawning every year and therefore should be distinguished from other iteroparous fish exhibiting partial migration.\nWhy does partial migration occur?\nAll hypothesized causes for partial migration are based on the premise that migratory behaviour is an adaptive response to availability of resources or presence of predators, which fluctuate over space and time (seasonally and daily); each individual migrates or remains resident to maximize evolutionary fitness.\nIn general, fish with lower body condition are more likely to be pushed into suboptimal conditions, i.e., less likely to take refuge migration and more likely to take feeding migration. In the case fo skipped breeding partial migration, spawning migration can be deferred in years when an individuals doesn’t have enough energy for grand and egg production.\nhave caused me to more deeply think about how impoundment has impacted the WS transboundary reach subpopulation\nMain questions are: 1. has impoundment blocked partial migration strategy that would have existed beforehand? (i.e., were WS migrating to spawning sites outside of transboundary reach)\nevidence for this: genetic population Columbia-Snake suggesting that these regions mixed historically divergent migration strategies in lake sturgeon in barrier-free HEC - divergent strategy in shortnose?\npotential evidence against: nechako and middle fraser distinct populations - suggesting hig spawning site fidelity, despite lack of barriers\nWhat are the consequences and management implications for this potential disruption in partial migration? transboundary reach should not be managed as a separate population recruitment may have been helped by very productive spawning grounds elsewhere disruption in salmonid partial migration likely large consequences on nutrient input and tropchic effects\nThere are major management implications for failing to recognize partial migration in populations.\nWhen the ability of populations to carry out partial migration is hindered or eliminated due to impoundment, this can have large consequences on ecosystem and implications for management.\nsturgeon and Partial migration in sturgeon species has not been well studied (at least relative to salmonids). A recent paper by Kessel et al. (2018) showed that 5 divergent migration strategies exist in Lake Sturgeon within the barrier-free Huron-Erie Corridor (HEC) of the Great Lakes.\n\n\n\n",
