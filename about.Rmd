Hi I'm Seb Dalgarno. 

I'm interested in all things rstats, fish ecology, acoustic telemetry, Bayesian stats, data visualization, and various other data/computery things. 

The blog name 'Fishy Data' is of course a little play on words. I work with fish data and this data is often fishy. The data cleaning process has forced me to become a better programmer and to think more deeply about efficient analysis pipelines.

I'm a PhD student in Eduardo Martin's [Freshwater Fish Ecology lab](https://www.ffishlab.ca/). We are using many years of acoustic telemetry data to investigate White Sturgeon movement and habitat use in support of recovery in the Upper Columbia River. Formerly, I was a computational biologist at [Poisson Consulting](https://www.poissonconsulting.ca). 

Check out my [consulting website](https://www.northbeachconsulting.ca/) if you'd like to hire me.
