    "contents": "\nThe study of animal movement has advanced a lot in recent years. Nathan suggests that advancements in animal tracking technology, environmental monitoring, and analytical methods (i.e. from increased computational power) have led to a general shift from the study of population redistribution (Eularian approach) to the study of individuals (Lagrangian approach). This has enabled development of more complex models (e.g. state-space models for individual animal movement) and increased understanding. However, Nathan suggests that a common framework is necessary to unify several paradigms for animal movement (i.e. biomechanical, cognitive, random, optimality) that are operating parallel to one another.\nIn this attempt to unify the study of animal movement, Nathan’s paper suggests that there are four overarching questions (note Nathan is talking generally about organismal movement, but I will narrow this down a bit to animals):\n1. Why do animals move?\n2. How do animals move?\n3. When and where do animals move?\n4. What are the external factors driving animal movement?\nFollowing from this, Nathan suggests that animal movement is a function of internal state (why), motion capacity (how), navigation capacity (when and where) and external factors (abiotic and biotic). In this formulation, the motion process and navigation process are both impacted by current location, internal state (i.e. physiological or neurological state affecting motivation and readiness to move) and external factors. The movement propagation process is the realized movement resulting from the motion process, which is optionally affected by the navigation process.\nFramework for animal movement (Nathan et al. 2008)The result of this process is a lifetime movement track, which is observed by us. This track can be parsed into sub-units at various spatial and temporal scales: movement paths that represent particular phenomena such as feeding or migrating; and at even finer scales, movement steps which could correspond to a few steps and a stop. Our ability to successfully identify movement phases depends on our ability to sample an individual’s movement (i.e. sampling frequency, duration and protocol).\nSpatiotemporal scales of sanimal movement (Nathan et al. 2008)This leads me to the first major challenge in the study of fish movement from acoustic telemetry arrays: limited sampling frequency and duration. Movement tracks from stationary receivers produce frequent and potentially large gaps in our knowledge of a fishes movement over time. These occur when a fish is moving or resting between receivers, or has died or emigrated outside of the receiver array.\nSpecialized statistical methods such as state-space models are required to separate the ecological state of interest from detection error. Hidden Markov Models are a class of state-space models useful for uncovering a finite number of states of interest (e.g., resident vs transitory states) with great potential for advancing the study of fish movement from acoustic telemetry by uncovering movement paths from ‘noisy’ data.\nThe utility of Nathan’s framework is to force us to more comprehensively think about different drivers of fish movement and to incorporate these into our models. Typical studies of fish movement patterns are primarily interested relating the internal state (i.e., motivations for moving such as feeding or spawning) with external factors (e.g., water temperature, discharge). These fall under the ‘optimality’ paradigm discussed by Nathan and common in landscape ecology.\nThe challenge therefore is to incorporate motion capacity and navigation capacity into our models of fish movement, thus brdiging the optimality paradigm with the biomechanical and cognitive paradigms. There is a lot potential here in the the use of Data Storage Tags to measure physiological or environmental information as a fish moves (e.g., water temperature, heart rate, muscle activity, acceleration). This would improve our understanding of the entire motion process (i.e., motion capacity in relation to internal state and external factors). We can also use our understanding of the cognitive or physiological aspects of navigation to improve our ability ot model the navigation process (i.e., navigation capacity in relation to internal state and external factors) along with the motion process.\nThrough advancements in technology (e.g., better tags, collection of physiological/environmental data as fish moves), statistical methods (e.g., state-space models), and understanding of navigation capacity of fish, there is great potential to apply Nathan’s framework for a unified animal movement paradigm to the study of fish movement with acoustic telemetry.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nWhat is a Hidden Markov Model\nHidden Markov Models (HMM) can be used for ecological time series data to uncover hidden ecological states. They do this by disentangling the observation process from the underlying (unobserved) state process. One important use for HMM is in movement ecology, where we can classify an animal’s movements into several modes (state) which help us to understand aspects of behaviour, physiology, resource selection, etc.\nA Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a special case of a state-space model that has a finite number of hidden states. A HMM is a heirarchical model consisting of a model for the observation process (state-dependent) and a model for the state process.The state process is not directyl observed; rather it is a hidden (or latent) variable. The observations (e.g. telemetry or capture-recapture data) are generated by this underlying state process. The observations are considered noisy measurements and are insufficient alone to determine the state.\nHMMs have two major simplifying assumptions, one each for the state process and observation process. A major assumption for the state process is he Markov property - the probability of a state being active at time t is dependent on the state at time t - 1. A major assumption for the observation process is conditional independence - the probability distribution of an observation at time t is completely dependent on the state at time t (and is independent of any other states or observations).\nA HMM is specified with three major componenets:\nthe intitial distribution - a vector of probabilities for each state at the start of the time sequence.\nstate transition probabilities - a matrix of probabilities for switching from any state at time t to another state at time t + 1.\nstate-dependent distribution - probability distribution of an observation conditional on the state at time t. This depends on the form of the observed data, e.g. count data are poisson distributed, positive continous data may be gamm distributed, etc.\nA model can be fit using Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian methods.\nApplication to fish movement\nAn HMM can be applied to a wide variety of questions existential, development at and spatial states at the level of individual, population, community or ecosystem. Here, I’m going to explore three potential applications for understanding fish movement/behaviour at the level of individual from capture-recapture and acoustic telemetry data.\nSurvival\nWe can estimate surival (an existential question) using the Cormack-Jolly Seber model, with 2 states (alive and dead),where the probability of transitioning from dead to alive is set at 0. In order to explore behaviours, we can extend the ‘alive’ state into multiple states, e.g. ‘alive and breeding’, ‘alive and non-breeding’.\nSpecification for a survival HMM (McClintock et al. 2020)Behavioral state (or movement phase)\nDisentangling multiple states from animal movement data can help to identify, for example, migratory phases, predation/feeding events, or hibernation/overwintering cycles. In these multi-state models of animal movement, observations are typically expressed as trajectories in 2-dimensional space, i.e. bivariate sequence of step-length (Euclidean distance) and turning angle. A two-state model could consist of ‘resident’ and ‘transient’, where movements in the ‘transient’ state correspond to longer step-lengths and more persistent turning angles. Step-length is typically considered to follow a gamma or Weibull probability distribution and turning angle is typically modeled with a von Mises or wrapped Cauchy distribution. The number of states in these types of models are typically not clear a priori and therefore need to be selected given biological understanding and possibly, model selection. The state transition probabilities are also not predetermined, but rather are freely estimated by the model and are completely data-driven.\nSpecification for a multi-state behaviour HMM with bivariate observation process (McClintock et al. 2020)Spatial location\nWe can predict movement to or from specific spatial locations, where each state corresponds to a site (e.g. spawning vs overwintering site). This follows the same model specification as the above behaviour example, but the observations are univariate site locations (e.g. A, B, 0 or unknown) and state transition probabilities are interpreted as fidelity/dispersal. In this case, we could use the model to predict location at times in the observation sequence where location is unknown. \n\n\n\n",
