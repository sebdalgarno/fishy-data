abstract = {{Failure to account for time‐varying detection ranges when inferring space use of marine species from passive acoustic telemetry data can bias estimates and result in erroneous biological conclusions. This potential source of bias is widely acknowledged but often ignored in practice due to a lack of available statistical methods. Here, we describe and apply a spatial point process model for estimating individual centres of activity (COAs) from acoustic telemetry data that can be modified to account for both receiver‐ and time‐specific detection probabilities. We use simulation testing to evaluate the suitability of the proposed models for estimating COAs and compare their performance to that of the popular mean‐weighted COA method for a variety of scenarios. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to correct for variable detection ranges by integrating data from moored test tags and demonstrate how accounting for time‐varying detection probabilities can impact space use estimates by fitting the model to data collected from a black sea bass (Centropristis striata) on a receiver array off the east coast of the United States. The proposed model reduced bias in COA estimates, particularly when tagged individuals occurred along the periphery of the receiver array. The test tag‐integrated model largely corrected the bias associated with receiver‐ and time‐specific detection probabilities. When applied to the black sea bass detection data, the model revealed fine‐scale movements not apparent when detection ranges were assumed constant. Spatial management practices for coastal marine species are often based on trends in space use inferred from passive acoustic telemetry data, which can be misinterpreted when factors influencing detection ranges are not accounted for. Our approach provides a general framework for estimating individual COAs that can be modified on a study‐specific basis to ensure resulting patterns of space use reflect a species’ movements and behaviour, rather than variation in receiver detection ranges.}},

The recent development of state-space modelling approaches for animal movement data provides statistical rigor for inferring hidden behavioural states, relating these states to bio-physical data, and ultimately for predicting the potential impacts of climate change.

Through a simulation study, we show that even simple linear Gaussian SSMs can suffer from parameter- and state-estimation problems. We demonstrate that these problems occur primarily when measurement error is larger than biological stochasticity, the condition that often drives ecologists to use SSMs. Using an animal movement example, we show how these estimation problems can affect ecological inference. Biased parameter estimates of a SSM describing the movement of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) result in overestimating their energy expenditure. We suggest potential solutions, but show that it often remains difficult to estimate parameters.

abstract = {{Acoustic telemetry technologies are being increasingly deployed to study a variety of aquatic taxa including fishes, reptiles, and marine mammals. Large cooperative telemetry networks produce vast quantities of data useful in the study of movement, resource selection and species distribution. Efficient use of acoustic telemetry data requires estimation of acoustic source locations from detections at receivers (i.e., “localization”). Multiple processes provide information for localization estimation including detection/non-detection data at receivers, information on signal rate, and an underlying movement model describing how individuals move and utilize space. Frequently, however, localization methods only integrate a subset of these processes and do not utilize the full spatial encounter history information available from receiver arrays. In this paper we draw analogies between the challenges of acoustic telemetry localization and newly developed methods of spatial capture-recapture (SCR). We develop a framework for localization that integrates explicit sub-models for movement, signal (or cue) rate, and detection probability, based on acoustic telemetry spatial encounter history data. This method, which we call movement-assisted localization, makes efficient use of the full encounter history data available from acoustic receiver arrays, provides localizations with fewer than three detections, and even allows for predictions to be made of the position of an individual when it was not detected at all. We demonstrate these concepts by developing generalizable Bayesian formulations of the SCR movement-assisted localization model to address study-specific challenges common in acoustic telemetry studies. Simulation studies show that movement-assisted localization models improve point-wise RMSE of localization estimates by >50\% and greatly increased the precision of estimated trajectories compared to localization using only the detection history of a given signal. Additionally, integrating a signal rate sub-model reduced biases in the estimation of movement, signal rate, and detection parameters observed in independent localization models. Movement-assisted localization provides a flexible framework to maximize the use of acoustic telemetry data. Conceptualizing localization within an SCR framework allows extensions to a variety of data collection protocols, improves the efficiency of studies interested in movement, resource selection, and space-use, and provides a unifying framework for modeling acoustic data.}},

Current methods to infer mortality indirectly from life-history parameters often fail to describe spatiotemporal or age-class specific variation in mortality rates.

This systematic review identifies the types of mark-recapture study designs that have used acoustic telemetry to date, including the species and habitats studied. The key benefits of acoustic telemetry mark-recapture studies are highlighted, and considerations for planning acoustic telemetry mark-recapture studies are presented to encourage their wider application.

Methods that can identify underlying behaviors driving specific movement patterns can help us understand how and why animals use available space, thereby aiding conservation and management efforts. For aquatic animal tracking data with significant measurement error, a Bayesian state-space model called the first-Difference Correlated Random Walk with Switching (DCRWS) has often been used for this purpose. However, for aquatic animals, highly accurate tracking data are now becoming more common. We developed a new hidden Markov model (HMM) for identifying behavioral states from animal tracks with negligible error, called the hidden Markov movement model (HMMM). We implemented as the basis for the HMMM the process equation of the DCRWS, but we used the method of maximum likelihood and the R package TMB for rapid model fitting. The HMMM was compared to a modified version of the DCRWS for highly accurate tracks, the DCRWS, and to a common HMM for animal tracks fitted with the R package moveHMM. We show that the HMMM is both accurate and suitable for multiple species by fitting it to real tracks from a grey seal, lake trout, and blue shark, as well as to simulated data. The HMMM is a fast and reliable tool for making meaningful inference from animal movement data that is ideally suited for ecologists who want to use the popular DCRWS implementation and have highly accurate tracking data. It additionally provides a groundwork for development of more complex modeling of animal movement with TMB. To facilitate its uptake, we make it available through the R package swim.}},

Popular telemetry systems in marine coastal fish consist of arrays of omnidirectional acoustic receivers, which generate a multivariate time-series of detection events across the tracking period. Here we report a novel Bayesian fitting of a SSM application that couples mechanistic movement properties within a home range (a specific case of random walk weighted by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) with a model of observational error typical for data obtained from acoustic receiver arrays. We explored the performance and accuracy of the approach through simulation modelling and extensive sensitivity analyses of the effects of various configurations of movement properties and time-steps among positions. Model results show an accurate and unbiased estimation of the movement parameters, and in most cases the simulated movement parameters were properly retrieved. Only in extreme situations (when fast swimming speeds are combined with pooling the number of detections over long time-steps) the model produced some bias that needs to be accounted for in field applications. Our method was subsequently applied to real acoustic tracking data collected from a small marine coastal fish species, the pearly razorfish, Xyrichtys novacula. The Bayesian SSM we present here constitutes an alternative for those used to the Bayesian way of reasoning. Our Bayesian SSM can be easily adapted and generalized to any species, thereby allowing studies in freely roaming animals on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of home ranges and territory establishment, both in fishes and in other taxa.}},

SCR methods make explicit use of spatial encounter information on individuals in order to model density and other spatial aspects of animal population structure, and they have been widely adopted in the last decade.

Our models of these detections provided estimates of the locations of individual sturgeon and the periods when individuals switched between spawning and resting behaviors. We anticipate that these models will be used to analyze acoustic surveys of other species and help design new surveys.}},

abstract = {{Telemetry, or the remote monitoring of animals with electronic transmitters and receivers, has vastly enhanced our ability to study aquatic animals. Radio telemetry, acoustic telemetry and passive integrated transponders are three common technologies that generate detection data — time‐stamped, tag‐specific records that are logged by receivers. We review current statistical methods and comment on potential future directions for analysing detection data derived from fixed telemetry receiver arrays. To illustrate how different methods may be used to achieve diverse study objectives, we provide a case study dataset collected by an array of 42 acoustic telemetry receivers on 187 bull trout in the Kinbasket Reservoir of British Columbia. To close, we present a decision tree for guiding the selection of a method based on study objectives and sampling design. This paper provides both experienced and novice telemetry researchers with the knowledge and tools to facilitate more comprehensive analysis of detection data and, in so doing, ask a wide variety of ecological questions that will enhance our understanding of aquatic organisms.}},

abstract = {{Ecological systems can often be characterised by changes among a finite set of underlying states pertaining to individuals, populations, communities or entire ecosystems through time. Owing to the inherent difficulty of empirical field studies, ecological state dynamics operating at any level of this hierarchy can often be unobservable or ‘hidden’. Ecologists must therefore often contend with incomplete or indirect observations that are somehow related to these underlying processes. By formally disentangling state and observation processes based on simple yet powerful mathematical properties that can be used to describe many ecological phenomena, hidden Markov models (HMMs) can facilitate inferences about complex system state dynamics that might otherwise be intractable. However, HMMs have only recently begun to gain traction within the broader ecological community. We provide a gentle introduction to HMMs, establish some common terminology, review the immense scope of HMMs for applied ecological research and provide a tutorial on implementation and interpretation. By illustrating how practitioners can use a simple conceptual template to customise HMMs for their specific systems of interest, revealing methodological links between existing applications, and highlighting some practical considerations and limitations of these approaches, our goal is to help establish HMMs as a fundamental inferential tool for ecologists.

abstract = {{Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes. ”Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever.“ (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium, 4th century B.C.)}},

abstract = {{State-space models (SSMs) are an important modeling framework for analyzing ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model population dynamics, animal movement, and capture-recapture data, and are now increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate between biological variation (e.g., in birth processes) and imprecision in the sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly modeled. Since the introduction of SSMs, a broad range of fitting procedures have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own SSMs. We provide the knowledge for ecologists to create SSMs that are robust to common, and often hidden, estimation problems, and the model selection and validation tools that can help them assess how well their models fit their data. In this paper, we present a review of SSMs that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists interested in learning about SSMs, introduce new tools to veteran SSM users, and highlight promising research directions for statisticians interested in ecological applications. The review is accompanied by an in-depth tutorial that demonstrates how SSMs models can be fitted and validated in R. Together, the review and tutorial present an introduction to SSMs that will help ecologists to formulate, fit, and validate their models.}},
